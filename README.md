Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems. It involves applying engineering principles, methods and tools. Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline  in the 1960s.
   This milestone marked the recognition that software development needed systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approaches akin to traditional engineering practices.
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
   Structured programming led to more readable, maintainableand less error-prone code. It influenced the development of programming languages like Pascal, C and Ada, which supported structured programming principles.
   3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
      Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration and iterative development over rigid planning and documentation. 


   List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
   2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
   3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. 
   4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
   5. Deployment: Realesing the software to users or customers.
   6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In regards to process, waterfall is linear and sequential while agile is iterative and incremental.
In regards to flexibility, waterfall has low(hard to accomodate changes) while agile has high(changes are expected and welcome)
In regards to customer involvement, waterfall has low(primarily at the beginning and end) while agile has high(continuous feedback throughout)
Example Scenario for waterfall is building a nuclear plant control system, building infrastructure.
Example Scenario for agile is developing a social media application.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer: Responsible for wrting code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments(IDEs) - Software suite that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems(VCS) - Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
Examples of VCS include git, subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Managing changing requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
   Strategies: Adopt Agile Methodologies, maintain clear communication and use a flexible architecture.
   2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
      Strategy: Priotize tasks using techniques like Eisenhower Mtrix or MoSCow method, breakdown tasks and use time management tools.
      3. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuta or suboptimal solutions, technical debt impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
      Strategies: Incremental Refactoring, document and plan and advocate for time to address debt.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Intergration testing: Testing interactions between diferent components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requrements to ensure it meets user needs. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possile responses from AI models.
Asking a vague question will make you get confusing answers. Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Define quality assurance and give its importance in software engineering.
Improved:  Define quality assurance in the context of software engineering, explaining its role, processes and importance in software development cycle.
The improved prompt is more specific and clear, guiding the response for both a definition and an explanation.
